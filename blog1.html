        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This study seeks to establish if the soil in C1 is suitable as a building material. To determine this, a series of experiments were carried out. The results of the experiment indicated that the soil is A-2-4 according to the AASHTO system and has the group symbol SC under the USCS classification system. The soil is currently compacted to 84.07% of its maximum dry density. Our results suggest that, considering proper standards are met and more compaction is done, appropriate road construction and building construction is possible on this soil. This study, however, acknowledges that further, more accurate experimentation on the soil is required before a conclusion can be made.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Geotechnical evaluation plays a pivotal role in determining the suitability of a particular soil type for construction purposes. In this study, we investigate the comprehensive evaluation of the soil in C1. This investigation will encompass an examination of key parameters, including particle size distribution, plasticity and compaction characteristics.</p>
        <p>As students, we have been assigned to check the feasibility of using C1 soil as a building material, using the knowledge we have. Our investigation also aims to bridge the gap between our theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering a deeper appreciation for the dynamic relationship between soil properties and construction viability.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of this activity was to determine how suitable is the soil present in C1 at NUST, H-12 as a building material.</p>

        <h2>Planning and Background</h2>
        <p>Soil has a bunch of different properties and construction work is done keeping them in mind. According to our knowledge as students of Soil Mechanics 1, we will be investigating soil size distribution, compaction, specific gravity and Atterberg limits. These will help us determine the behaviour of the soil and hence the kind of construction possible.</p>
        <p>The first task which was decided was to figure out the size distribution of the soil. This would be done through sieve and sedimentation analysis. Particle size distribution helps us in knowing what particles are present in the soil which is helpful in determining properties. We can also obtain the coefficient of uniformity and curvature through these experiments. The soil can be classified using the data we receive from these experiments.</p>
        <p>The second task was determining the specific gravity of soil as it dictates how soil behaves and how dense it is in comparison to water. It is also used in the calculation of the hydrometer analysis which will be performed.</p>
        <p>Third, we decided to find out the Liquid Limit and Plastic Limit of the soil. From this, we can find out the Plasticity Index of the soil and classify it. This will help us in understanding how the soil behaves. Highly plastic soil may be more prone to landslides. We can also determine how the soil reacts in the presence of water using this experiment.</p>
        <p>Lastly, to determine compaction of soil, we decided to carry out the standard proctor test and core cutter test. From the standard proctor test, we'll obtain the Maximum Dry density (MDD) of the soil and the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC). From core cutter we'll find the in-situ field density of the soil and compare it with the MDD. This will tell us if the soil is compact enough or not.</p>
        <p>Considering the tests to be performed and keeping extra soil in case, 15kg soil will be extracted from the site and brought to the lab where it will be oven dried. Then the tests will be performed on the soil.</p>

        <h2>Experiments</h2>
        <h3>1. Sieve Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To identify the particle size of our soil and draw a particle size distribution curve.</p>
        <p><strong>Standards:</strong> AASHTO T 88, ASTM D422</p>
        <p><strong>Apparatus:</strong> Set of ASTM sieves, Balance (sensitive to 0.1 grams), Soil pulverizer, Soft brush, Oven dried sample</p>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, we take the sample to be analyzed.</li>
            <li>Then we pulverize the sample slowly and efficiently to breakdown the clumps so that our reading and curve should be perfect.</li>
            <li>Then following the standard ASTM D6913/D6913M-17 standard we proceed further.</li>
            <li>Sieves were set in descending order, with the largest sieve no on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Then we take 422 grams of oven dried soil.</li>
            <li>We shake the sieve forward and backward for over 10 to 12 minutes to ensure that the material has been thoroughly separated into different particles.</li>
            <li>Then we calculate retained mass on each sieve.</li>
            <li>Lastly, we draw the particle size distribution curve.</li>
        </ul>

                <td>0.49</td>
                <td>0.116</td>
                <td>99.884</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Add other rows as needed -->
        </table>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>We obtained the following results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Percentage gravel: 0%</li>
            <li>Percentage sand: 69.79%</li>
            <li>Percentage fine: 30.21%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the percentage passing of sieve #200 is more than 10%, so we will do hydrometer analysis to further classify.</p>

        <h3>2. Hydrometer Analysis</h3>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To determine the particle size distribution of soil passing No 200 sieve.</p>
        <p><strong>Standards:</strong> AASHTO T 87-70 & T88-70, ASTM D 421-58 & D422-63</p>
        <p><strong>Apparatus:</strong> Two graduated glass cylinders of 1000ml, Dispersing agent, Hydrometer (152H), Balance, Thermometer, Mixer, Stopwatch</p>
        <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measure 40 grams of soil, which passed through the No. 200 sieve and was pulverized. Prepare a 125ml solution with 5g sodium hexametaphosphate.</li>
            <li>Transfer the solution and soil into the mixer and mix for approximately 5 min.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer all contents of the cup into the 1000 ml cylinder and add water till the 1000ml mark.</li>
            <li>Cover the cylinder with the palm of the hand and mix the contents thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Place hydrometer in the cylinder and take reading on different time intervals such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120 minutes and so on.</li>
            <li>Record the temperature readings as well.</li>
